      "content": "The website was written in the Polymer 1 framework initially, in 2017 - the web client was rewritten in Polymer 2. The web moves fast and in the last three years many things have changed on the platform, there's good support for custom elements/web components, shadow dom, the fetch API. While the web has evolved to include newer features, features that the client relied on has also been removed. HTML imports was removed at the start of this year - which Polymer 2 heavily relied on. Additionally, the Polymer 2 platform is kind of heavy - at least for unbundled sites. Instead of rewriting the client using Polymer 3, the client will move even further towards #usetheplatform. Starting now the client is being rewritten using only platform features, with the addition of lit-html for lightweight and speedy rendering. This means that many of the material components being used has to be re-implemented using lit-html - this will create a tiny components library that will be published.",
